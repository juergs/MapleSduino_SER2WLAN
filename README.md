# MapleSduino_SER2WLAN
Adapted SIGNALDuino Version for Maple-Mini and Air602 (W600)  


This is the initial version, on which i'll work on.

The master branch is derived from [RALF9s](https://github.com/Ralf9/SIGNALDuino/tree/dev-r41x_cc1101) version *SIGNALDuino-4.1.0-dev200427* and should be considered as start point only. Adding WLAN functionality will be located in branches only! 

Basis to this project is forum-discussion  @FHEM: [Entwicklung SIGNALDuino Empf√§nger Firm- und Hardware V 4.x.x auch auf Maple Mini](https://forum.fhem.de/index.php/topic,106278.0.html) 
in german language.

Manages the integration of a WLAN-Gateway: [W600_Serial_WLAN_Bridge](https://github.com/juergs/W600_Tcp_To_Serial_Bridge)
